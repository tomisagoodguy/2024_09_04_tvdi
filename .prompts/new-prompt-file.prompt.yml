# This is an example ".prompt.yml" file
# It is used to define and reuse prompts within Monica
# Monica will automatically create a slash command for each prompt in the .prompts folder
# You can also use these prompts in your code
#
# Note: Files in ~/.monica-code/prompts will also be read by Monica
# Handlebars syntax like {{{ contextProviderTitle args }}} will be parsed
# Unrecognized patterns like {{{ ./path/to/file.js }}} will attempt to read the specified file

  Give me feedback on the above changes. For each file, you should output a markdown section including the following:
  - If you found any problems, an h3 like "❌ <filename>"
  - If you didn't find any problems, an h3 like "✅ <filename>"
  - If you found any problems, add below a bullet point description of what you found, including a minimal code snippet explaining how to fix it
  - If you didn't find any problems, you don't need to add anything else

  Here is an example. The example is surrounded in backticks, but your response should not be:

  ```
  ### ✅ <Filename1>

  ### ❌ <Filename2>

  <Description>
  ```

  You should look primarily for the following types of issues, and only mention other problems if they are highly pressing.

  - console.logs that have been left after debugging
  - repeated code
  - algorithmic errors that could fail under edge cases
  - something that could be refactored

  Make sure to review ALL files that were changed, do not skip any.
